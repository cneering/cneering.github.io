                <h1>Wine and Cannabis Tour</h1>
                <p class="noMarginP">Welcome to High Expectations Tours! Thank you for checking us out as we are just a small company from Sonoma that takes pride in taking out small groups to explore some of the best that Sonoma County has to offer… World Class Wines and Cannabis! If you choose to partake in a day with us, it will be in a small group setting so you all will get to know one another… and what a fun/educational way to meet new friends over wine and Cannabis! We want to give you the experience that we would show to our friends and family when in town for a visit. We have long term relationships with small family wineries that will pour small production wines available only at their cellar door. If you want to visit the larger commercial wineries on a big bus then this experience is not for you. Your fun local guide/educator will have extensive knowledge of the Sonoma County wineries as well as the history of the area relying on their personal experience in the business and further education such as certification from the CWE or Sommelier program. High Expectations Tours is fully insured and our guides/educators are subject to random drug testing required to hold a Commercial Driver License. Rest assured that you can kick back and relax knowing that your environment will include not only a lot of education, and fun, but most importantly you are in safe professional hands for the day. Our mission for you is have an awesome educational fun day playing in our back yard of Sonoma County!</p>
                <p class="noMarginP">We would love to take you and your group out, at this time our pick up locations are located in San Francisco, so take a look at the FAQ button for time and pick up locations…It’s Union Square @9:45 and Fisherman’s Wharf @10:00. Lots of good info there but for any additional questions please give us a call at 707-732-8432 and a friendly voice will be happy to have a chat with you.</p>
                <!-- <p>Be prepared to enjoy a day of world class wines and cannabis in Sonoma County! Your highly educational fun experience will involve a guide from the wine industry with a minimum 1st level Sommelier certification. As a client on High Expectations Tours you will have access to a private educational tour involving the world of cannabis at a top dispensary to begin the day! Your experience continues to wine country that will include being handed off to another certified Sommelier with a bag full of wine and driving into the vineyards with stops to walk amongst the vines and taking photos with some of the best views in Sonoma County!</p> -->

                <h2>Ready for some fun!!!</h2>
                <p>Please bring a current ID, and cash, which is required for any Cannabis Dispensary purchases. Keep in mind that part of the tour will involve walking in the vineyards so think about appropriate footwear for the day. Weather is much different in SF to wine country so plan on dressing in layers. A cooler of cold water will be on board that will also have a tasty beverage for each client to start the day!</p>
