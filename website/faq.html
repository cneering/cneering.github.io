                <h1>Wine and Cannabis Tour FAQ</h1>
                <h3>Where do you pick up in SF?</h3>
                <p>The first pick up location is at Union Square @9:45 in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel on the corner of Post and Powell St. at the Post St. lobby. Second location is at Fisherman’s Wharf at 10:00 in front of the Maritime Museum on the corner of Jefferson and Hyde. Please arrive early so we can get you all checked in and start the day.</p>
                <h3>How long is the tour?</h3>
                <p>It depends on how much fun the group is having! At the end of the day you will get back to SF via Golden Gate Ferry from Larkspur or Sausalito depending on the schedule and traffic. We usually get you on the 5:45 departure then it’s a 35 minute boat ride to soak in the awesome views on the bay.</p>
                <h3>Why are tasting fees and lunch not included?</h3>
                <p>A full day out is $125 per person. Our tours are priced lower to give you more options with lunch and tasting fee’s. The wineries have different tasting options to choose from. Maybe part of the group loves red wine while the rest prefers whites. Usually there is the standard tasting menu or you might prefer the reserve list while looking for that special bottle. Our partnered wineries will also extend benefits such as waived fee’s with a single bottle purchase or two for one discounts. Not everyone is into having a sandwich and a bag of chips for lunch and some people have strict diet restrictions such as glutton free. Our lunch stop at Big Johns Market has you covered!</p>
                <h3>This is my first time to Wine Country so what should I expect?</h3>
                <p>After picking up the group there is a stop at the Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point for some quick pics. Next stop is a Cannabis Dispensary with a knowledgeable Budtender who will guide the group explaining the process from farm to product and what the differences are. After picking up your goodies, now its time to taste some wine. The first winery will provide a complimentary behind the scenes tour in the production facility as well as a walk in the vineyard. Pick up lunch for a winery picnic and tasting then off to another winery.</p>
                <h3>What do I need to bring for the day?</h3>
                <p>You will need a valid ID showing that you are at least 21 and cash for any Cannabis purchases. Credit and Debit cards are accepted at the wineries. Comfortable walking shoes as part of the day will include a vineyard tour. Weather in SF is much different than Wine Country, especially in the Summer, so you might want to think about dressing in layers because chances are it will be a warm day. Staying hydrated through out the day is important so there will be lots of cold water on board.</p>
                <h3>Can I use any Cannabis on the van?</h3>
                <p>While we want you to have an awesome day, please no Cannabis use on the van. There will be designated areas at the wineries that will allow you to do so. However, your guide will have a corkscrew opener…</p>
                <h3>Is gratuity included?</h3>
                <p>No, gratuity is not included since we feel that should be left up to you to choose the amount. The suggested amount is 15% or 20%...but don’t let that hold you back if you had an incredible time!</p>
